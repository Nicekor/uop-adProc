Advanced Programming Concepts Coursework

Application developed in Java using the Swing API for the Advanced Programming Concepts unit (2nd Year) in a group of 4 members.

The original repository of this project was deleted by one of the members with the following commit "I am deleting eveything incase this is picked up on the plagarism check, which would be a bit awkward. I have put everything on google drive instead."

For this reason I am creating this new repository as I can not recover the previous repo.
